# Genshin Wish Tracker

> ### **If you are an employer:**
> Genshin Impact is a video game that includes heavy elements of luck. Players' past luck determines their future luck because there are pity systems. **The goal of this project is to have a simple, fast and beautiful way of tracking past luck.** It started as a simple notepad and then I added coloring to make it clear where I got lucky. I then added some scripts to calculate how far I am from the pity, how much game currency I need to reach there and how lucky I was overall.  
> Only relevant part is [Code.gs](Code.gs) which includes all the functions and algorithms. They are all documented clearly.

With the recent changes to banner history (now you can only see wishes from the past 6 months), I decided to keep track of my own wishes like many other people. I also added a few helpful things while at it, such as **pulls left for pity** and **average pulls you did to get 4 and 5 stars**. You can use them to compare your luck to your friends' or just plan ahead.

You've probably seen such spreadsheets before but the part that this one differs is it's ease of use! **All you need to do is to write the name of the item you pulled and that's it!** Colors, count and all other information is filled in automatically. **The names are case insensitive.** If you mistype something, that cell simply won't get the color it should.

If there are any features you want me to add to the spreadsheet or if you found any issues, let me know.

## How to use:
Open [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19SQmN9GvcykKp3sT2ENQRulyJ5ktf7LGEdbLuNKTqYg/edit?usp=sharing), click "File" and then "Make a copy" to start using.

The only sheet you need to edit is `Pulls`. Simply type the name of your pull in the corresponding column. Names are case insensitive. **You can also just write 3, 4 or 5 instead of the full name. Which will be seen as any 3, 4 or 5 star. Because most people don't care about which 3 star they get.** The sheet does everything else itself. Go to the `Info` sheet to see information about your pulls and pity. 

If the cell doesn't get the color it should, you either mistyped or that item is new. You have to add the weapons and characters that'll come in the future yourself. That's really simple too! There is a sheet called `Rarity`, simply write the name of the weapon or character under the corresponding rarity.

## Changes done based on feedback from Reddit:
- [x] Typo in "Xingqiu"
- [x] Option to type 3, 4 or 5 in the cell instead of full name
